# TestLab

_Testing Component-based Software_

### Introduction

In this assignment, we apply unit, integration and GUI tests for the Asteroid game.

### Objectives

The objective of this assignment is to get familiar with unit and GUI tests, provide sufficient information to get
started with testing using JUnit for unit and user test in combination with a component framework.

### Classwork

- Read [JUnit Getting started](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Getting-started). If you have the need to stub
  or mock out dependencies to create your test then i can recommend [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito).
- Write a unit test for one of the components. For example, write a test for moving the player ship or a test for
  collision detection.
